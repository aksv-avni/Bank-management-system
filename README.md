# Bank Management System

### This was my first project in the field of Computer Science. It was the school project given to me by my teacher.
### It is written in C++.
### With the help of this project I understood important concepts in C++ language like Control and Conditional Statements, Classes, Inheritance, Files and Exceptions. 
### Also I got to know about handling big code, debugging and writing clean code.
